<p>Back in the noughties, the global economy was growing at a healthy clip, and the finance industry was feeling great. Essentially, things were a bit like this.</p>

<p>Of course, it couldn’t last. The good times had largely been financed by lots and lots of debt. Eventually the US housing market started to crack, and the downturn was magnified and spread across the world by complex financial instruments. At first most people were just nervous.</p><img class="img--full" src="http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA2LzE4L2ZhL1NjcnVicy5kMjhmZC5naWYKcAl0aHVtYgkxMjAweDk2MDA-/56779cac/9f9/Scrubs.gif" alt="">

<p>But when people started to realise the extent of the rot in the financial system, all hell started to break loose.</p><img class="img--full" src="http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA2LzE4LzYwL1N0YXJUcmVrLjczZDlhLmdpZgpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/c8a37435/f01/Star-Trek.gif" alt=""> 

<p>Eventually Lehman Brothers, one of the giants of Wall Street, was forced to declare bankruptcy, turning a financial crisis into a global vortex. The outcome wasn't pretty.</p><img class="img--full" src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/HhTXt43pk1I1W/200.gif" alt="">

<p>
Luckily, the US central bank had a Great Depression expert at the helm. Determined to prevent  the global economy from slipping into something even worse than the 1930s downturn, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke cut interest rates to zero and cranked up the electronic printing presses, creating trillions of dollars to buy bonds and prevent a financial and economic armageddon.</p> <img class="img--full" src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/qNW3D88UCL2NO/200.gif" alt="">
<p>Eventually, financial markets were hauled back from the brink, and soon enough began humming again thanks to the extra money coursing through the financial system. Investors were having a ball again.</p><img class="img--full" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hZj44bR9FVI3K/giphy.gif" alt="">
<p>But all good things must come to an end. In 2013 the Federal Reserve said that it was planning to start tapering its bond-buying programme, often called quantitative easing. Although investors should have known it couldn't continue forever, their reaction was less than sanguine.</p><img class="img--full" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/tJwj0RDHsKmLm/200.gif" alt="">
<p>
But eventually the so-called “taper tantrum” eventually subsided, largely because the Fed insisted loudly and repeatedly that actually lifting interest rates was still a very distant prospect. Mollified, investors calmed down and starting pushing markets even higher, as the US economy continued to heal.</p><img class="img--full" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/HkB9ayXS3Rzos/200.gif" alt="">

<p>However, the US economic recovery now looks entrenched. While inflation remains extremely subdued, unemployment has fallen to almost 5 per cent, and the Federal Reserve is considering whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years this year - perhaps as early as this month.</p>

<p>Many economists and investors are fairly sanguine about this prospect, arguing that it has been so well-signalled that everyone is prepared, and point out that the Fed is likely to lift interest rates only extremely carefully.</p><img class="img--full" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/MUVFUXkCp0DNS/200.gif" alt="">
<p>But there are some experts that are more worried. They fear that after the extraordinary monetary stimulus that has propped up financial markets in recent years, investors are simply not prepared for higher interest rates. Some sort of turbulence is inevitable, they argue, and in extremis it could end up something like this:</p>
